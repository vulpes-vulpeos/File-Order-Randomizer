# File Order Randomizer (macOS)
A simple script and app that can randomize files order by adding random numbers at the beginning of files names.
Itâ€™s useful if your car is too dumb to shuffle a lot of music properly.

It automatically count how many digits random number is needed, it will detect if file was already randomized and rerandomize it. While unrandomizing it ignores files which do not start with number and automatically counts how many numbers it needs to delete (supported separators: "_", ". ").

**AppleScript:**

You can create an "app" with Script Editor. Open .scpt file, in menu bar go File -> Export... . For File Format select Application, for Code Sign select Sign to Run Locally.

**Bash:**

use ```chmod u+x forand.sh``` to make it executable
Probably it will also work on Linux.

**C++/AppleScript:**

You can compile it with g++: ```g++ -std=c++2a -O2 -Wall \"${file}\"  -o \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\" ```
Or download .app bundle from release section. You'll need to allow it's launch in Settings -> Security & Privacy -> General tab.

Tested on m1 Air with macOS Monterey.
